# GAMES103-HW4
## Introduction
In this case, we can see the shallow waves effects on the surface and a two-way coupling result between cubes and surface.

The pool is incompressible and has a clear boundaries.

## Hydrodynamics
To simplify the problem, we use height field to represent the waves based on Euler grid and pressure to update the velocity field.

## Coupling
Two rigid cubes can create waves on the surface and float on the water due to buoyancy.

## Interaction
User can press 'r' to randomly generate waves and drag the left cube by mose to see the two-way coupling effects.
